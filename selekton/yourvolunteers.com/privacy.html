			<b>Last Updated 2015-02-28. Please see the Sharing of your information section below. Basically,

			<h4>How We Collect and Use Information</h4>
			We (YourVolunteers, hereafter "Service") collect the following types of information about you:<br /><br />
			
			<b>Information you provide us directly:</b><br />
			We ask for certain information such as your username, real name, address, phone number and e-mail 
			address when you register for a YourVolunteers account, or if you correspond with us. We may also 
			retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User 
			Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you 
			the features and functionality of the Service. Your information is provided to the volunteer managers 
			of the organizations for which you are a volunteers.<br /><br />
			
			<b>Activity information:</b><br />
			Because the feature has been requested repeatedly by the managers that use our service, we have 
			added on 2014-05-19 limited volunteer activity tracking collection that is made available to your 
			volunteer managers. This includes, but is not limited to, when a volunteer logs in, when a volunteer 
			adds or removes shifts, and when a volunteer opts in or out of The Week Ahead emails. You may ask 
			your volunteer manager to show you what information is made available to them and that will show 
			you the limits of what information is collected by us. We DO NOT collect information about what pages 
			or shifts or messages that you view while using our service. That information may fall in the analytics 
			section below and is not linked to your individual volunteer account.<br /><br />
			
			<b>Analytics information:</b><br />
			We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to help us 
			measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your 
			browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in 
			improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it 
			cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.<br /><br />
			
			<b>Cookies information:</b><br />
			When you utilize the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string 
			of alphanumeric characters  to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets the Service 
			identify who you are and therefore enhances your navigation through the site. The cookies are designed to 
			be session cookies that only last for the single session; therefore we do not use the cookie data to determine 
			your usage of the Service. These session cookies are removed when you log out of the service or visit the 
			login page. If you set your browser to refuse all cookies, you will not be able to use the Service. <br /><br />
			
			Our service also utilizes advertising. The advertisers may choose to place a persistent cookie on your 
			device. If you have questions about these cookies, contact the Service and we will provide to you a link 
			where you may contact the advertiser directly.<br /><br />
			
			<b>Log file information:</b><br />
			Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the 
			Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These 
			server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, 
			browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, 
			domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.<br /><br />
			
			<b>Sharing of your information:</b><br />
			The service, its parent company and those who have access to your information for reasons of the development 
			of the Service, will not sell or re-use your information. Since your information is also visible by the 
			volunteer managers and volunteer leads of the organization, you will need to contact the organization 
			directly to determine how they use your information.<br /><br />
			
			<b>What happens in the event of a change of control:</b><br />
			We may buy or sell/divest/transfer the company (including any shares in the company), or any combination of 
			its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Your information such as customer names and email addresses, 
			User Content and other user information related to the Service may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred 
			in these types of transactions. We may also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information in the course of 
			corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar 
			transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the company.<br /><br />
			
			<b>Instances where we are required to share your information:</b><br />
			YourVolunteers will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe 
			that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce 
			our Terms of Service or to protect the security, quality or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect 
			the rights, property, or personal safety of YourVolunteers, our Users, or others.<br /><br />
			
			<b>Sharing certain service type information we collect about you:</b><br />
			We may share aggregate information obtained through logs with third-party businesses interested in advertising on 
			the Service. These third-party businesses will not receive any information about you as the individual.<br /><br />
			
			<h4>How we store and protect your information</h4>
			<br />
			<b>Storage and Processing:</b><br />
			Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States. Database information 
			will not be intentionally transferred to countries outside of the United States except as described in the "What 
			happens in the event of a change of control" section above.<br /><br />
			
			<b>Keeping your information safe:</b><br />
			YourVolunteers cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to 
			preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your 
			privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your 
			identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of 
			your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from 
			YourVolunteers, at all times. However, YourVolunteers cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information 
			you transmit to YourVolunteers or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, 
			altered, or destroyed.<br /><br />
			
			<b>Compromise of information:</b><br />
			In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, YourVolunteers 
			will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose 
			information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.<br /><br />
			
			<h4>Your choices about your information</h4>
			<br />
			You control your account information and settings: You may update your account information and opt-out of receiving 
			The Week Ahead and Daily Summary emails from us at any time by logging in to your account and changing your 
			profile settings.<br /><br />
			We make every effort to promptly process all opt-out requests . As noted above, you may not opt out of 
			The Week Ahead and Daily Summary emails. However, if you want to stop receiving all communications including those 
			related to the use of the service (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, 
			changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices), you will need to contact us and we will 
			remove your account from the service.
